## Why I create this API?
- I need to create my own API for whatever purpose it is..but I don't have any idea at the moment. So I create an API that would remind me certain activities during the day.
- I want to learn Springboot, Docker, AWS, CI/CD all that stuff. So this project will be my pet project


## Current feature
- Unit Test : Yes using JUnit4
- CI/CD : Yes using Travis and Coveralls for code coverage 
- AWS : I am deploying this application to AWS
- Docker : Partially..later I want to deploy in AWS by using docker. Right now, we are still uploading jar file.
- Using MySQL for quick learning purpose. You can run the MySQL docker.

## What I want to add in the future
- Integration Test
- Using profile when deploy to stg/pro
- Integrate with Slack
- Integrate with another API which use different stack (I want to learn Cassandra also)
